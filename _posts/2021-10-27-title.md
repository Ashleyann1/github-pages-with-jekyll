Despite not being a musician, music is an important factor in my life.
Music evokes a sense of calmness during times of stress, but it can also fuel my waves of rage and bring forth the tears I’ve been holding back.
Music is the love and understanding that illuminates dark times and the serenity during great times. When words aren’t enough, music helps you communicate unexplainable emotions.

Music is also a bridge between cultural heritages and different backgrounds. 
It erases the line that defines all borders and allows a group of distinct people feel the same thing at the same time.
